Hi! My name is Beno√Æt Choffin and this is my webpage. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique (LRI), University of Paris-Saclay in France. My current research interests cover the use of machine learning for optimizing human learning. I am especially interested in building adaptive and personalized algorithms for improving human learners' long-term memory.
